## Developer Instructions

### `pre-commit` hooks

This repo uses [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to run linting and formatting checks.

Install the `pre-commit` hooks by first installing the `pre-commit` command globally if you do not already have it:
```sh
# Install pre-commit; see https://pre-commit.com/#install
$ pip install pre-commit
```

Then add the `pre-commit` hooks to your locally checked-out repo:

```sh
$ pre-commit install
```
